Hi! My name is Yash, I'm born and raised in the Bay Area, and I'm a third-year double majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science. This will be my fourth quarter tutoring for DSC 10, and I'm excited to finally meet students in-person! I truly enjoy mentoring and working with students, so please feel free to reach out! In my free time, I enjoy paddleboarding in Mission Bay, playing tennis, cooking, and watching sports (go Warriors and Niners)!
