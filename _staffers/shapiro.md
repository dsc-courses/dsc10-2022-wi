Hi everyone! My name is Ethan and I'm a second year Data Science major originally from Newport Beach, CA. In my free time I play video games, go to the gym, hang with friends, sing and play guitar, and anything in between. I'm super excited to be a tutor for DSC 10 and be able to help you all enjoy programming and data science as much as I do!
