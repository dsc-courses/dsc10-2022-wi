I'm a second-year student from Beijing, China, who doubled major in data science and linguistics. Outside of the classroom, Iâ€™m a piano player and a soccer fan. Welcome to DSC 10, the first stop of our great journey to the world of data. It is one of my favorite courses at UCSD, and I hope you all enjoy it.
