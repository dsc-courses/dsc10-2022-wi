Hi everyone! I'm a second year Data Science major in Revelle. I really enjoyed DSC10, so I can't wait to help y'all become more comfortable with coding. I'm from San Diego originally, and I enjoy dancing (I'm on a couple UCSD teams), skating, and reading. If you have any questions about course materials, feel free to email me or stop by my OH!
