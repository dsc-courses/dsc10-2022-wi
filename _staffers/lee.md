Hi everyone, and welcome to DSC 10! My name is Dylan (but you can just call me Dyl for short), and I'm a third year Data Science major and Cognitive Science minor in Sixth College! I'm one of the student representatives on behalf of HDSI, so please feel free to ask any questions regarding this class in particular or the entire major in general! Outside of school, I enjoy watching the NBA, retail therapy, and discovering new music! (Send me your playlists!!)
