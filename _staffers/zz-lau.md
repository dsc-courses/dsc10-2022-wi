I'm Sam, a PhD student in Cog Sci. To study what students find tricky when writing data science code, I'm holding extra OH for DSC 10. I think of it as a win-win: I help with your assignments, and you can help me see what challenges you face in learning data science.
I have 5 years of experience TA'ing for data science courses, instructed the Intro to Data Science course at UC Berkeley, and am writing a [textbook on data science](http://www.textbook.ds100.org/).

Hope to see you in office hours!
