Hey everyone! I'm a third-year Data Science major from Singapore. This is my first time tutoring for DSC 10, and I'm thrilled to help you guys get started on your DS journey :) Outside of class, I spend a lot of time watching TV, and am currently hooked on Survivor. Feel free to drop by my OH to discuss any or all of the above :)
