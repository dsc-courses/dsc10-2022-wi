## Frequently Asked Questions for DSC 10, Winter 2022

### I have a conflict with the final exam (e.g. Math 18). Will you offer alternate final exams times?

Yes. Expect a form to be sent out in the first few weeks of the course where you can indicate to us that you have a conflict.

### Will we use the "LAB" time?

No â€“ you can ignore the LAB section that appears on WebReg, we will not use this time for anything. We **will** use the discussion timeslot, though.

### Will lectures be podcasted?

Yes. Attendance will not be required.

### Should I take DSC 10? ðŸ¤”

Of course!
