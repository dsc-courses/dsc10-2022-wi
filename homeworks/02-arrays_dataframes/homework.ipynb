It's up to you to ensure that your answer is correct. If you're not sure, ask someone (not for the answer, but for some guidance about your approach). These are great questions for office hours (see the schedule on the [Calendar](https://dsc10.com/calendar)) or Campuswire. Directly sharing answers is not okay, but discussing problems with the course staff or with other students is encouraged. \n",
