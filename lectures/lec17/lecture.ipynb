    "    - A test statistic that allows us to compare how \"different\" two categorical distributions are.\n",

    "    - So far, we've been assessing models given a single random sample.\n",
    "        - We flip a coin 400 times. Are the flips consistent with the coin being fair?\n",
    "        - Did the jury panel in the Swain case look like a random sample from the eligible population?\n",
    "        - Are the test scores for the TA's section a random sample from the class's scores?\n",
    "    - But we often have **two** random samples we wish to compare.\n",
    "        - Example: birth weights of babies born to smoking mothers vs. non-smoking mothers üë∂.\n",
    "        - Example: drops in pressure for footballs from two different teams (Deflategate) üèà.\n",
    "    - **Permutation testing** (i.e. **A/B testing**) will help us decide whether two random samples come from the same distribution."
